# Cole_Aidan_Sea_Level_Rise_Vulnerability_Index

In this project, I will attempt to calculate sea level rise vulnerability in a holistic way, taking into consideration the issue's multi-faceted nature. More specifically, using Los Angeles ACS demographic data, spatial/proximity data, DEM/elevation data, and historical/current sea level rise data, I will create a model that calculates each census tract's relative vulnerability. After mapping these results, I will write a report in which I use my findings to persuade the City of Los Angeles to roll-out climate adaptive strategies in the areas that I highlight as needing them the most. 

This repository currently holds the data that I will be using in my project in the raw_data folder. All intermediate coding progress is saved in the scripts folder. Initial project brainstorm and presentation with context and process is also available for viewing pleasure in the brainstorms_and_presentation folder.
